3. It is important to choose a license because there is space to choose exactly how you want your software to be handled, while still being part of free software. For instance, you can decide whether people can use your trademark, not to be held liable, sublicense, and others. Choosing a license lets others know exactly what they can and cannot do.

4. You are unsure about the legal ramifications of using such a project. You may get in trouble without realizing. By having a free software license, the project lets others know that it is available for use, and how. If there isn't one, then it is uncertain what the rules regarding it is.

5. For the most part, I agree. Gopher's stance on their project made people feel it may become licensed and prevented many others from contributing to the project. I think if this came up before the hacker mentality and community was formed, it would've been possible but that was several tens of years before Gopher even was thought up. The largest problem is that Gopher did not see that the Web was garnering support from the community and using their resources, while Gopher was giving them cause for concern.

  The Microsoft .NET Core was not initially open source. This created problems in which teams for different platforms were creating similar code since they could not see what others were working on. It was extremely inefficient since there was duplicated code for things that did not need to be duplicated, separate bugs, and different versions on entirely separate codebases. 
  Thus, they decided to upload to Github and allow others to collaborate on .NET Core. This would allow others to work on the code, create a singular code hub from which it can expand to account for different platforms, and be more inclusive in the community.

  They used the MIT license, likely because it is extremely permissive, which follows through with what they were trying to do -- be more inclusive to the community. They probably wanted to jump straight into open source and do so by choosing a very nonrestrictive license.
